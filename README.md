Computer vision routines in Python, based on Szeliski's "Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" (2011).

This library is mostly for my own learning purposes, since I find I understand concepts better after coding them out; but perhaps you might find something useful.

### Modules ###
* __color.py__: Color spaces (Szeliski section 2.3)
* __imgproc.py__: Image processing (Szeliski chapter 3)
* __transforms.py__: Geometric transformations (Szeliski Section 2.3)
* __utils.py__: Miscellaneous utility functions
