Computer vision routines in Python, based on Szeliski's "Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" (2011).

This library is mostly for my own learning purposes, since I find I understand concepts better after coding them out; but perhaps you might find something useful.

### Modules ###
* __imgform__: Image formation (Szeliski chapter 2)
  * __color.py__: Color spaces
  * __transforms.py__: Geometric transformations
* __imgproc__: Image processing (Szeliski chapter 3)
  * __filters__: Filters
    * __kernels.py__: Filter kernels
    * __linear.py__: Linear filters
    * __nonlinear.py__: Nonlinear filters
  * __imgproc.py__: General image processing
  * __pyramids.py__: Image pyramids
* __tests.py__: Unit tests
* __utils.py__: Miscellaneous utility functions
